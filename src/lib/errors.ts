// src/lib/errors.ts  [shared — integration]
/**
 * THE single Convex-error-code → user-copy map.
 *
 * Convex functions throw stable machine codes, never user copy (`throw new
 * Error("illegal-move")`). A rejected mutation reaches the browser wrapped in
 * transport noise, e.g.
 * `[CONVEX M(games:makeMove)] [Request ID: …] Server Error\nUncaught Error: illegal-move\n  at …`,
 * so codes are matched as **substrings** of the message, never compared for equality.
 *
 * Two layers used to keep their own copies of this table — `providers/convex-errors.ts`
 * for the lobby/settings toasts and `useGameController` for the move path — which drifted
 * (same code, two different sentences). They now both read this module:
 *
 * - `describeConvexError()` — the toast layer (lobby, matchmaking, settings, room picker).
 * - `describeGameError()`   — the in-game layer; identical except for the handful of codes
 *   in `GAME_OVERRIDES`, where the game board says something more specific.
 *
 * Every string that either layer showed before the merge is preserved verbatim, because
 * `src/lib/__tests__/errors.test.ts` asserts them — and that same test re-reads `convex/**`
 * and fails if a newly thrown code has no copy here.
