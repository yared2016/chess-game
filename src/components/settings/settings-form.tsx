// The settings sections of UI_REDESIGN §6: Room, Board, Camera & motion,
// Graphics, Engine, Account — plus Credits, which is a licence obligation (§I-7)
// and therefore has to stay reachable in the UI.
//
// `SettingsForm({ save })` keeps its exact pre-redesign contract because the game
// screen renders it inside the "Room" drawer (U2) and persists the 2D/3D toggle
// through the same writer (FR-15); two writers would fire two mutations per
// change. `SettingsWorkbench` (settings-workbench.tsx) is the /settings page's
// two-column arrangement of this same form.
