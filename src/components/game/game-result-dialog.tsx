// The verdict, said once. A Fraunces headline, one result line, one rating line
// in mono, and the three ways out in a single row.
//
// What this round removed: the inner box (a card inside a dialog is a nested
// card), and the badge cluster that restated in three chips what the sentence
// above it had already said. Initial focus lands on "Play again"; the page
// behind is inert while the dialog is open (Base UI's modal dialog does that).
//
// The delta and the take-back line stay EXCLUSIVE: a game with take-backs is
// unrated (FR-43), so it gets the sentence and no number.
//
// PURE: the rating row and the rematch mutation are fed in by `GameShell`, so
// /dev/game can open this dialog with no Convex at all.
